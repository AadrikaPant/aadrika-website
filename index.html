      <h1>Hi! I’m <span class="highlight">Aadrika -</span> <br>a passionate educator </h1>
      <p>I believe education isn’t just about answers — it’s about asking better questions. With chalk on my hands and big ideas in my head! I teach English and Social Science, which means I get to dive into powerful stories, spark debates, and help students make sense of the world and their place in it.

        With a Master’s in Social Work, I believe learning isn’t just about textbooks — it’s about empathy, action, and real-world change. I thrive on organising projects, creating impact beyond the classroom, and being in the heart of community-led missions that matter.
        
        If there’s a cause to champion or a team to lead, you’ll probably find me there — with a to-do list in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other.</p>
